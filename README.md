# Simon Game

*[Read in French 🇫🇷](README_FR.md)*

As part of my final project for my **first year of master's degree**, I developed a **Simon Game** as a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** using **React JS**.

The Simon Game is a memory game where the user has to follow a sequence of colors that progressively becomes more complex. The goal is to correctly reproduce the sequence without making any mistakes, with increasing levels of difficulty.

## 🎮 Features  
- **Color Sequences**: The game generates a random sequence of colors that the user has to memorize and repeat.
- **Difficulty Levels**: The more the user successfully reproduces the sequences, the harder the game becomes.
- **Local Notification**: A local notification is displayed when the user loses the game, alerting them of the result.
- **Vibration Effect**: A vibration occurs when the machine plays the color sequence, enhancing the user experience with haptic feedback.

This project allowed me to apply my **web development skills** while creating an engaging and interactive game.

## 📅 Project Timeline  
This project was completed in **March 2025**, during my first year of master's degree.
